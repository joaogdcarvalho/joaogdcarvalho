# João G. de Carvalho

I’m a software engineer with experience in development since 2015. I hold a degree in Systems Analysis and a specialization in Software Architecture. Over the years, I’ve faced a variety of challenges, building web applications, desktop solutions, and system integrations. My primary focus is on **JavaScript, TypeScript, and .NET**, and I’m always committed to writing high-quality, scalable, and well-structured code.

I enjoy solving problems efficiently and creating solutions that truly make a difference.
